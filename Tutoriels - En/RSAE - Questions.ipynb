    "\n",
    "The purpose of recommender systems is, as the name implies, to make personalized recommendations. Ideally, these recommendations will have to be good, although this concept seems fuzzy. Unlike other tasks in machine learning, such as the cats images recognition or stock market predictions, making recommendations to help a user is more complex. Is the aim to present a specific user with suggestions that reinforce her previous choices? Do we want to present complementary or totally independent suggestions for the items previously considered? Will we try instead to present her items to which she has not yet been exposed? Each of these options are correct and can be modeled. Without loss of generality, the diagram below simply models the issue of recommendation systems from the perspective of machine learning.\n",

    "<img src = \"../Images/High_level_1.png\" width = \"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, in the context of this workshop, that is, either the suggestion of movies on streaming platforms such as Netflix or Amazon Prime, we can reduce the problem to a relatively simple task: recommend movies that the user will like according to her past interests. In order to carry out this task, we will use all the preferences of the users, certain associated sociodemographic variables as well as certain characteristics of the movies. Finally, we can refine the diagram as follows:\n",

That being said, these function spaces are defined by a set of parameters whose number tends to increase with the complexity of the data. Once space is defined by a set of fixed parameters, we can vary the different values of the hyperparameters in order to empirically explore function spaces. To choose the set of optimal parameters and hyperparameters, we define a metric that allows us to evaluate the model; for example, how much the image of a cat seems likely.\n",

    "The notion of training and test set in the framework of recommender systems is somewhat different from what is usually seen with so-called supervised problems. If in the context of a supervised problem, the test set consists essentially of new observations (lines from a file) which are independent of observations previously observed in the training set. The paradigm is significantly different when we work with recommendation systems.\n",

    "Indeed, because of the mathematical model on which the recommendation systems are based, the data belonging to the test set are not linked to a new individual, but rather to new evaluations made by the same set of individuals. As a result, the data associated with the training, validation and test sets are no longer independent as assumed (the famous <i>iid</i> hypothesis) which complicates things theoretically.\n",

    "For example, instead of using film ratings made by an individual as an input layer (hence 1682 neurons), we could use the ratings of individuals for a particular movie (and thus 943 input layer neurons). In this modeling, we could incorporate the different types of films and/or their year of release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we could simply get ourselves away from autoencoders and ogle other types of architectures. Considering the different functions and class previously coded, we could implement a multilayer perceptron (MLP). To do this, the inputs of the network would be exactly the same, with the difference that the targets would consist only of unvisited films."
